-Softaware: Phython 3.7 VS code 1.62.3

- There were "x" otes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
  - Candidate 1
  - Candidate 2

  - Candidate 3 received "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes
- The winner of the election was:
  - Candate (1,2,3) who received "x%" of the vote and "y" number of votes
## Challenge Overview
- Read the file object with the reader function
- Open the data file
- Write down the names of all the candidates
- Add a vote count for each candidate
- Get the total votes for each candidate
- Get the total votes cast for the election
- Using the open() function with the "w" mode we will write data to the file
- Determine the percentage of votes for each candidate by looping through the counts
- Determine if the votes are greater than the winning count
- If true then set winning_count = votes and winning_percent = vote_percentage
- Save the winning candidate's name to the text file
- print out each candidate's name, vote count, and percentage of votes 
- Save the results to our text file
